# Language Practice App (Cursor brief)

## Product goal
Intensive vocabulary + grammar practice.

## Core concepts (data)
- `words`: the learner’s vocabulary items
- `questionTypes`: templates that generate questions from words
- `attempts`: generated questions + user responses + scoring/metadata for future selection

## Stack
- TypeScript + React (Vite SPA)
- React Router (library mode)
- Tailwind CSS
- Cloudflare Kumo styled components (use Tailwind for layout/spacing)
- Convex backend service

## Definition of done
- `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` pass
- UI remains accessible (labels, focus, keyboard navigation)
- Business logic for selection/scoring lives in Convex functions (not in route components)
- Update docs when behavior/data changes (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`)
