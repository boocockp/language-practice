# Convex conventions

- Validate all function arguments at the boundary.
- Keep selection/scoring logic in Convex (not in React routes).
- Name functions by intent (e.g. `generateQuestion`, `logAttempt`, `pickNextItems`).
- Conceptual collections:
  - `words`
  - `questionTypes`
  - `attempts`
- Add indexes for frequently-used selection queries.
