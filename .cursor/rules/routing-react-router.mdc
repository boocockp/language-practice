# Routing (React Router library mode)

- Use `createBrowserRouter` + `RouterProvider` as the router entry point.
- Keep route components in `src/routes/*Page.tsx`.
- Shared layout/nav lives in `src/app/AppLayout.tsx`.
- Route map (top-level pages):
  - `/` Home
  - `/practice` Practice
  - `/words` Words
  - `/question-types` QuestionTypes
  - `/stats` Stats
  - `/settings` Settings
- This is an SPA: deployment must rewrite unknown paths to `index.html`.
